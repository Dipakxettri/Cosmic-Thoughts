# Simulation of the Universe and Consciousness

Sitting on a bench, lost in thought, I expressed my belief — I am a strong believer that this world might be just a simulation created by higher intelligent beings. It definitely feels possible. Just like in video games, NPCs (non-player characters) interact like humans even though they are simply programmed AI bots. They follow patterns and use the data we provide. They don’t possess consciousness like we do — they don’t truly “think” — but their world is still a simulation.

Maybe we are just like advanced NPCs in a far more complex and realistic simulation. This world may even be just an illusion. We might be more intelligent than the NPCs we know today, but we could still be part of a designed system. There could be countless simulations — layers upon layers — and we might be inside just one of them.

I began to wonder if the laws of nature and the rules of our universe are all part of a carefully planned design by higher beings. What if this isn’t the only simulation? What if there are nested simulations — one within another, like layers of code or levels in a game? The simulation we are living in could be the latest version, and the creators of our simulation might themselves be inside a simulation too.

In my opinion, our scientific progress is just a tiny part of something much larger. Perhaps we are only at 1% of what’s possible. The beings who created our world might be observing our development, just like game developers watching their AI learn and evolve. As science keeps advancing, it feels like we're slowly uncovering pieces of the code behind our reality.

One day, we might be able to create a full simulation ourselves — a world within our world — and at that point, the simulation we’re in would be seen as just one level higher. Maybe we’d call ours the second simulation, while the first remains forever unknown.
