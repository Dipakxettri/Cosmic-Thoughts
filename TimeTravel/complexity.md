## Complexity

When we watch movies and TV series where a person travels to the past or future by just using a date, it looks fascinating and interesting. It even feels like it could be possible in real life. But in reality, time travel is much more complex than what we see and think. So why is time travel so complex?

As per my own thoughts: What actually is time? What are past, present, and future? Do they really exist? Time feels like a straight array that continuously flows. Actually, there is no past or future — the only thing that exists is the **present**, even in some sense. The world, the present moment, and how it behaves and flows are much more complex. Since time flows continuously, the present is always changing. The present at one point becomes the past in just a second — so there is no fixed or absolute present, not even a true past or future. The present is like an infinite loop that keeps flowing.

Present flows like counting numbers as fast as we can. There are more than 100,000,000+ "present moments" in a day — even in an hour. For example, I am sitting on a bench writing this journal. At this very point, tons of present moments are passing — which means **present is infinite**.

So past, present, and future all flow in infinity. And this is where the **complexity of time travel** begins. To travel to a **specific point**, we would need to calculate and reach **each of these infinite moments** — whether it's in the future or past. It’s not like selecting a date and hour from a calendar and the time machine just lands us there. Is it really that simple? Huh?

Actually, it’s **not possible** to time travel just by selecting a date from the calendar — because the calendar is not a natural entity. It's a human-made system. To make time travel really happen, we would have to calculate and reach the real-world, natural flow of infinite past, present, and future moments — and that is **very complex**.

With current technology and scientific progress, it's not possible.  
But in the future, it might become possible.
